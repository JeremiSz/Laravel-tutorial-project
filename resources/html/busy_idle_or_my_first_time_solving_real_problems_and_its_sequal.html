<p>A few years back, I was living with a friend of mine. He had been working remotely for some time then. However, with most staff being moved to remote only work, I noticed his routine had changed. He was running to and from the toilet and bringing food and drink into his home office. Most of all, he stayed sitting there, never getting up even when he was clearly zoned out.</p><p>One day, we were talking about remote work he explained that he knew managers were adapting to remote only work and details were still up in the air. As such, he did not want to give them any reason to doubt his work by any yellow away dots. Yet all the automatic mouse movers he found for windows looked dubious. Up to that point, I had only made software for course work and fun, never to solve real problems people had. As such, I snapped up at the opportunity.</p><p>I quickly slapped together a UI from Windows Forms I had covered recently and researched how to do system calls from C#. Within the day, I had something working so it was time for testing. I handed it off to my friend. Within hours, he was back with requests for various tweaks, features and changes. We went back and forth like this a good few times, adding a shortcut to stop and quit, adding a toggle to keeping the screen awake for power saving, and adding more delay options.</p><p>That cycle felt as rewarding as the first time I designed my own tool outside of course work. With meaningful feedback, good iteration can maintain morale as we see our work help people. This is by no means scalable, but I do wonder if development teams would be more motivated if they were allowed to engage more in the business analysis side. Though that could be just me.</p><p>As for the PowerShell sequel, that same friend later came to me and said he had gotten tired of always needing to set the values in the GUI to his defaults. It had been 2 years and 3 OSs since I made the original. Looking around, I found I only had the source code to an older build. Thankfully, I already knew C# was quite easy to decompile from older projects. I extracted the source code from a newer build but then researching C# compiling, I found it would be a headache to try to build it without Visual Studio. So, my friend suggested PowerShell as he commonly used it. I did initially try to reuse much of the code with PowerShell\'s ability to use C# code. That too became a headache, so the system calls were dropped in place of simple fake key presses.</p><p>Personally, I am not happy with this version, but my friend prefers the way he can use shortcuts to set the defaults he likes. At the end of the day, we build software for our users.</p><p>So that is the story of Busy Idle.
